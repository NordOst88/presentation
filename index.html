					<aside class="notes">
						The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory lead to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.
						You can see the history of creating and evolution of the major high-level programming languages on the slide. It may seem that the story begins in the early 50s, however the first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945.

							<li>no goto</li>
						</ul>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						It was the first high-level programming language to be designed for a computer.
						While working on his doctoral dissertation, Zuse developed the first known formal system of algorithm notation capable of handling branches and loops. In 1945, Zuse described Plankalkül in an unpublished book. The collapse of Nazi Germany, however, prevented him from submitting his manuscript.
						Plankalkül includes assignment statements, subroutines, conditional statements, iteration, floating point arithmetic, arrays, hierarchical record structures, assertions, exception handling, and other advanced features such as goal-directed execution.

					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						The first functioning programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the early 1950s. John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949 and originally known as Brief Code, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer. William Schmitt implemented a version of Brief Code in 1949 for the BINAC computer, though it was never debugged and tested. Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.
						Speedcoding was the first high-level programming language created for an IBM computer. The language was developed by John Backus in 1953 for the IBM 701 to support computation with floating point numbers. Here high level means symbolic and aiming for natural language expressivity as a goal as opposed to machine or hardware instruction oriented coding.
						Speedcoding was also the first implementation of decimal input/output operations. Although it substantially reduced the effort of writing many jobs, the running time of a program that was written with the help of Speedcoding was usually ten to twenty times that of machine code. The interpreter took 310 memory words, about 30% of the memory available on a 701.

					<aside class="notes">
						In 1954, FORTRAN was invented at IBM by a team led by John Backus; it was the first widely used high-level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper. Originally developed for scientific and engineering applications, it is a popular language for high-performance computing for now. FORTRAN dramatically changed forever the way computers are used. It encompasses a lineage of versions, each of which evolved to add extensions to the language while usually retaining compatibility with prior versions.

					<aside class="notes">
						Another milestone in the late 1950s was the publication, by a committee of American and European computer scientists, of "a new language for algorithms"; the ALGOL 60 Report. This report consolidated many ideas circulating at the time and featured three key language innovations:
						-	nested block structure: code sequences and associated declarations could be grouped into blocks without having to be turned into separate, explicitly named procedures;
						-	lexical scoping: a block could have its own private variables, procedures and functions, invisible to code outside that block, that is, information hiding.
						Another innovation, related to this, was in how the language was described:
						-	a mathematically exact notation, Backus–Naur form (BNF), was used to describe the language's syntax. Nearly all subsequent programming languages have used a variant of BNF to describe the context-free portion of their syntax.

					<aside class="notes">
						Algol's key ideas were continued, producing ALGOL 68 (9 slide):
						-	syntax and semantics became even more orthogonal, with anonymous routines, a recursive typing system with higher-order functions, etc.;
						-	not only the context-free part, but the full language syntax and semantics were defined formally, in terms of Van Wijngaarden grammar, a formalism designed specifically for this purpose.

						The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s was the next major historic event in programming languages. By opening up a radically new platform for computer systems, the Internet created an opportunity for new languages to be adopted.

Various other scripting languages achieved widespread use in developing customized applications for web servers such as PHP.
